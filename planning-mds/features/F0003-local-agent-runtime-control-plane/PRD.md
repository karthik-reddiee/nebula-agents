# F0003 - Local Agent Runtime Control Plane PRD

## Feature Header

**Feature ID:** F0003
**Feature Name:** Local Agent Runtime Control Plane
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** Platform Hardening
**Status:** Draft

## Feature Statement

**As a** product build operator
**I want** a local runtime control plane around native agent sessions
**So that** Nebula Agents can launch, inspect, summarize, retrieve evidence from, and learn from agent runs without losing the native interactive workflow.

## Business Objective

- **Goal:** Turn the planned cockpit into an executable local runtime layer with stable commands, status APIs, evidence retrieval, summarization, metrics, and reviewed learning proposals.
- **Metric:** A user can launch or inspect a local agent run, query current status through CLI or MCP, retrieve full evidence by stable ID, view concise summaries, and review proposed process corrections after failed runs.
- **Baseline:** The framework has strong role, action, gate, and evidence contracts, but most runtime behavior is still planned in feature documents.
- **Target:** Nebula Agents has a small, testable local runtime API that supports F0001 tmux-native operation and supplies concrete interfaces for F0002 managed orchestration.

## Problem Statement

- **Current State:** Agents can follow markdown contracts, but run state, evidence discovery, status inspection, transcript summarization, and feedback from failed runs remain manual or feature-level plans.
- **Desired State:** Nebula provides local commands and machine-readable surfaces that make session state, gates, evidence, summaries, and runtime health observable without replacing native provider CLIs.
- **Impact:** Operators get faster recovery and review loops, while future managed orchestration receives stable contracts instead of inferring behavior from terminal output alone.

## Scope & Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Local command surface for launch, wrap, session list, status, attach guidance, validator execution, and evidence inspection.
- Provider capability report and launch guards for supported local agent CLIs.
- MCP-compatible read-only tools for session status, gate status, validator status, and evidence lookup.
- Local evidence artifact store with stable artifact IDs, redacted public summaries, and full local retrieval paths.
- Deterministic summarizers for transcripts, command logs, validator output, and evidence manifests.
- Runtime metrics dashboard for run duration, gate wait time, validator results, transcript health, and evidence freshness.
- Failure-learning proposal workflow that drafts process corrections for human review instead of writing them automatically.

**Out of Scope:**
- Hosted multi-user orchestration.
- Provider account management or credential storage.
- Automatic approval of lifecycle gates or provider tool calls.
- Model-output compression that changes what the native provider sees during F0001.
- Removing tmux-native fallback.
- Writing learned corrections directly into framework or product instructions without review.

## Acceptance Criteria Overview

- [ ] A `nebula-agents` local command surface exists for preflight, wrap launch, sessions, status, validators, evidence, and attach guidance.
- [ ] Provider capability reports determine whether launch is allowed, degraded, or blocked.
- [ ] MCP-compatible read-only tools expose session, gate, validator, and evidence status.
- [ ] Evidence artifacts receive stable IDs and can be summarized or retrieved locally without storing secrets.
- [ ] Deterministic summarizers preserve errors, failed commands, gate decisions, artifact paths, and open questions.
- [ ] Runtime metrics are visible in a local dashboard or status view.
- [ ] Failed-run learning produces reviewable proposals with provenance and never mutates instructions without approval.

## UX / Screens

| Screen | Purpose | Key Actions |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Runtime Home | Show local runtime health, active sessions, and latest gate status. | Launch, inspect, attach, run validation. |
| Capability Matrix | Show provider readiness and blocked capabilities. | Run probe, inspect remediation, select fallback. |
| Evidence Browser | Browse summaries and retrieve full artifacts by stable ID. | Open summary, copy path, verify redaction status. |
| Metrics View | Show run duration, gate wait time, validator history, and transcript health. | Filter by run, export status, inspect failures. |
| Learning Review | Show proposed corrections from failed runs. | Accept, edit, reject, link evidence. |

## Key Workflows

1. Runtime preflight - operator verifies local dependencies and provider capability before launch.
2. Wrapped launch - operator starts a native session through a Nebula command that records run metadata and starts watchers.
3. Read-only inspection - operator or agent queries status through CLI or MCP without attaching to the terminal.
4. Evidence retrieval - reviewer follows stable artifact IDs from summaries to full local evidence.
5. Failure learning - failed run output is summarized into proposed process corrections for human review.

```

The runtime registry is the coordination point. Native sessions remain interactive, while CLI, TUI, and MCP surfaces read the same structured state and evidence indexes.

## Data Requirements

**Core Records:**
- `run_id`: Stable local run identifier.
- `provider_key`: Supported provider identifier.
- `provider_capabilities`: Capability report used for launch gating.
- `session_ref`: tmux session name or future managed session ID.
- `runtime_status`: Ready, running, blocked, degraded, completed, failed, or abandoned.
- `gate_status`: Current lifecycle gate and decision state.
- `validator_results`: Latest command, exit code, duration, artifact path, and summary.
- `artifact_id`: Stable ID for evidence, transcript, command log, or summary.
- `artifact_kind`: Transcript, command-log, validator-output, manifest, status, metric, or learning-proposal.
- `summary_text`: Redacted deterministic summary.
- `retrieval_path`: Local path to full artifact.
- `learning_proposal_status`: Draft, accepted, edited, rejected, or archived.

**Validation Rules:**
- Artifact IDs are unique within a run and stable across reloads.
- Retrieval paths stay inside approved workspace, runtime, or evidence directories.
- Summaries must not include raw secret-like values.
- Learning proposals must link to source artifact IDs.
- Launch is blocked when required provider capability probes fail.

## Role-Based Access

| Role | Access Level | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Local Operator | Launch, attach, validate, inspect metrics, review proposals | Uses local shell trust boundary. |
| Reviewer | Read session state, inspect evidence, run read-only validation | Cannot launch unless local policy allows it. |
| Architect | Approve runtime contracts and capability matrix shape | Required for F0002 handoff. |
| Security Reviewer | Review redaction, retrieval boundaries, and learning proposal safety | Required before closeout. |

## Success Criteria

- Operators can inspect run state and evidence without manually reading raw terminal logs first.
- Reviewers can trace every summary back to full local evidence.
- Capability failures block unsafe launch paths and show fallback guidance.
- Runtime metrics make stalled gates, failing validators, missing transcripts, and stale evidence visible.
- Failure-learning proposals improve process quality while preserving human control over instruction changes.

## Risks & Assumptions

- Risk: Summaries omit details needed for review. Mitigation: every summary links to full artifact retrieval.
- Risk: MCP tools become a mutation surface. Mitigation: F0003 MCP tools are read-only except explicitly named validator execution commands.
- Risk: Runtime state drifts from actual tmux sessions. Mitigation: session probes reconcile registry state before status is reported.
- Risk: Learning proposals overfit one failed run. Mitigation: proposals require human review and source evidence links.
- Assumption: F0001 provides the initial tmux session metadata and transcript capture hooks.

## Dependencies

- F0001 tmux-native session registry and transcript capture model.
- Existing lifecycle gates and evidence-contract prompts.
- Existing product-manager story and tracker validators.
- F0002 adapter contract will consume the runtime capability and event shapes after F0003 proves them locally.

## Rollout & Enablement

- Deliver as an opt-in local runtime layer after or alongside F0001 implementation.
- Keep direct native CLI and tmux attach usage available at all times.
- Require read-only status surfaces and evidence retrieval before adding managed-provider orchestration defaults.
