# F0003-S0003 - MCP Status and Evidence Tools

## Story Header

**Story ID:** F0003-S0003
**Feature:** F0003 - Local Agent Runtime Control Plane
**Title:** MCP status and evidence tools
**Priority:** High
**Phase:** Platform Hardening

## User Story

**As a** reviewer using an AI coding tool
**I want** read-only MCP tools for Nebula session, gate, validator, and evidence status
**So that** I can inspect runtime state without attaching to the terminal or manually opening artifact paths.

## Context & Background

The framework is tool-agnostic, but MCP-compatible hosts can benefit from a narrow status surface. The first MCP tools should be read-only and should expose existing runtime state rather than becoming another orchestration path.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Happy Path:**
- **Given** the local runtime registry contains at least one run
- **When** an MCP host calls `nebula_session_list`
- **Then** the tool returns active and recent run IDs with sanitized status
- **When** the host calls `nebula_session_status` with a run ID
- **Then** the tool returns provider, action, feature, gate status, validator status, evidence summary, and attach guidance when allowed
- **When** the host calls `nebula_evidence_list`
- **Then** the tool returns artifact IDs, kinds, summaries, freshness, and retrieval availability
- **When** the host calls `nebula_evidence_show` with an artifact ID
- **Then** the tool returns the redacted summary and local retrieval metadata, not raw secret-bearing content

**Alternative Flows / Edge Cases:**
- MCP SDK is unavailable; command reports install guidance and CLI status remains available.
- Unknown run ID returns a structured not-found error.
- Artifact exists but fails redaction validation; tool refuses content and reports redaction failure.
- Runtime directory is unreadable; tool returns a permission error without stack traces.
- MCP server is invoked outside a workspace; tool returns setup guidance.

## Interaction Contract

| Surface / Entry Point | User Action | Editable State | Save / Mutation Result | Reload / Persistence Evidence | Roles / Status Constraints |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| MCP `nebula_session_list` | Query sessions | No editable state | None | Reads runtime registry and live reconciliation | Reviewer, Local Operator |
| MCP `nebula_session_status` | Query one run | No editable state | None | Reads persisted status and artifact index | Reviewer, Local Operator |
| MCP `nebula_gate_status` | Query gate state | No editable state | None | Reads gate decision records | Reviewer, Local Operator |
| MCP `nebula_validator_status` | Query validators | No editable state | None | Reads latest validator artifacts | Reviewer, Local Operator |
| MCP `nebula_evidence_list` | Query artifacts | No editable state | None | Reads artifact index | Reviewer, Local Operator |
| MCP `nebula_evidence_show` | Query redacted artifact summary | No editable state | None | Reads summary and retrieval metadata | Reviewer, Local Operator |

Required checks for mutation stories:
- [ ] All F0003 MCP tools are read-only.
- [ ] Tool responses are bounded and machine-readable.
- [ ] Errors are structured and do not leak credentials or stack traces.
- [ ] Tests cover success, not found, unreadable runtime, missing MCP SDK, and redaction failure.

## Data Requirements

**Required Fields:**
- `tool_name`: MCP tool identifier.
- `run_id`: Run being inspected.
- `gate_status`: Current gate state when available.
- `validator_status`: Latest validator state.
- `artifact_id`: Evidence artifact identifier.
- `summary_text`: Redacted summary text.
- `retrieval_available`: Boolean.

**Optional Fields:**
- `attach_guidance`: Local attach command or explanation when unavailable.
- `freshness_status`: Fresh, stale, missing, or unknown.
- `error_code`: Structured error code for failures.

**Validation Rules:**
- MCP tool names must be stable and documented.
- Raw artifacts are not returned unless a future explicitly approved tool allows it.
- Response payloads must include schema version.
- Unknown run or artifact IDs return structured errors.

## Role-Based Visibility

**Roles that can use MCP status tools:**
- Reviewer - Can inspect status and redacted evidence.
- Local Operator - Can inspect all status visible to local user.
- Architect - Can inspect schema and contract compatibility.

**Data Visibility:**
- InternalOnly content: Local retrieval paths when policy allows.
- ExternalVisible content: Redacted summaries, status, and freshness markers.

## Non-Functional Expectations

- Performance: Common MCP status calls complete within 1 second.
- Reliability: Tool responses are deterministic for fixture-backed runtime registries.
- Security: MCP tools default to read-only behavior and strict redaction.

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- F0003-S0001 runtime status command.
- F0003-S0004 artifact index.

**Related Stories:**
- F0003-S0005 summaries provide the content exposed by evidence tools.

## Business Rules

1. Read-only first: MCP tools inspect runtime state and evidence summaries.
2. Bounded output: Tools must avoid returning unbounded transcripts or logs.
3. Artifact traceability: Every evidence response must preserve artifact ID and retrieval metadata.

## Out of Scope

- MCP mutation tools for gate approval.
- Remote MCP service hosting.
- Raw transcript streaming through MCP.

## UI/UX Notes

- Screens involved: MCP tool configuration, runtime status view.
- Key interactions: Query session list, inspect status, inspect evidence summary.

## Questions & Assumptions

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should MCP setup be installed by `nebula-agents mcp install` or documented for manual host configuration first?

**Assumptions (to be validated):**
- Read-only MCP inspection is enough for the first runtime integration.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Permissions enforced through local runtime read policies
- [ ] Audit/timeline logged as N/A for read-only calls, with optional access metrics only
- [ ] Tests cover MCP tool contracts and errors
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Story filename matches `Story ID` prefix
- [ ] Story index regenerated or updated
